# Test-GMock-1

## Overview

This repository contains some tests using [GoogleMock Matchers](https://google.github.io/googletest/reference/matchers.html) together with CMake.

Please, refer first to my repository [test-gtest](https://github.com/RicardoRagel/test-gtest) to check how to setup and use Google Test. The setup and usage of this repository is the same, the only difference is the kind of tests that it will be performed by the [example_test.cpp](test/example_test.cpp) file. 

In the case of this repository, we will use **gMock Matchers**, which are a more advanced type of tests under gTest.
